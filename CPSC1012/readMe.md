temporarily figure out the way to run C# in vs code and write code in here first

<!-- DECLARE audienceSize as Integer

DECLARE conversionRate as Float
DECLARE numberOfConversions 
PROMPT: Enter the audince size: (read)
PROMPT: Enter the conversion rate: (read)
//process: 
Calculate: numberOffC = AS * CR
output:
PRINT the numberOfC ( round to nearest whole number) -->
