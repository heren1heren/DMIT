    <p>
        In HTML, the figure tag is used to include self-contained information such as illustrations, diagrams, or code
        listings
        in a document. It is linked to the main flow, but it may be used at any place of a document, and the figure
        flows
        with
        the content, thus removing it should not impact the flow of the document. HTML5 includes a new tag for this
        purpose.

            The Difference Between Figure and Image Tags
            The image tag is used to add an image to an HTML page.

            A figure is used to semantically organize or group the content of images, diagrams, blocks of code, and / or
            a
            caption
            in the document. It provides a way to wrap this content and group it together.
