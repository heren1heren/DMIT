                <h3>NHL Origins of the Oilers</h3>
                <p>
                    The Edmonton Oilers became part of the NHL in 1979 during the NHL-WHA merger. The Oilers joined the
                    NHL
                    for
                    1979-80,
                    along with fellow WHA teams Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and the Jets following a merger
                    agreement
                    between
                    the
                    two
                    leagues.

                <p>
                    The Oilers boast some of the most skilled forwards in the league, led by captain Connor McDavid,
                    Leon
                    Draisaitl,
                    and
                    Ryan Nugent-Hopkins. Their offensive prowess makes them a formidable force in the NHL.

                <p>
                    The defense core is led by Evan Bouchard, Darnell Nurse and veteran Mattias Ekholm, an anchor on the
                    blue
                    line.
                    These
                    players are key players in maintaining a strong defense and puck control on the ice.

                    In net, the Oilers rely on Stuart Skinner and backup goaltender Calvin Pickard to provide stability.
                    Both
                    goaltenders
                    bring a blend of skill and experience, critical for the team's success in high-pressure situations.
