            <h2>History of Hipsterism</h2>
            <p>
                The term "hipster" has evolved over time, reflecting different cultural movements and social dynamics
                throughout
                the
                20th and 21st centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the term "hipster" is less commonly used to define a specific group but still invokes ideas of
                alternative
                culture, individualism, and a rejection of the mainstream—however, these ideas have also been absorbed
                into
                the
                broader
                culture.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Hipsters: The 1940s</h3>
            <h4>Origins in Jazz Culture</h4>
            <p>
                The early hipsters were heavily influenced by the jazz scene, particularly the African-American
                musicians
                who
                pioneered
                the genre. Jazz, with its improvisational and rebellious spirit, became a symbol of resistance against
                the
                rigid
                structures of society.
            </p>
            <p>
                They were drawn to the bohemian, carefree lifestyle embodied by jazz legends like Miles Davis and
                Charlie
                Parker,
                who
                rejected mainstream success in favor of artistic freedom.

            <h4>Style and Attitudes</h4>
            <p>
                Early hipsters embraced a bohemian lifestyle characterized by loose, casual clothing, a love for
                intellectualism,
                and a
                distaste for materialism. Their fashion choices and nonchalant attitudes set them apart from mainstream
                culture.
            </p>
            <h3>The Beat Generation: 1950s</h3>
            <h4>Expansion of Hipsterism</h4>
            <p>
                The Beats, led by figures like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, continued the hipster tradition by
                rejecting
                conventional society. They explored alternative spiritualities, experimented with drugs, and wrote about
                their
                disillusionment with American values.

            <h3>Modern Hipsterism: 1990s to 2000s</h3>
            <h4>Rebirth in Urban Centers</h4>
            <p>
                By the 1990s, hipsterism resurfaced as a subculture in urban environments. Modern hipsters gravitated
                towards
                indie
                music, vintage clothing, and artisanal goods, often in reaction to mass-market consumerism and corporate
                culture.
            </p>
            <h4>Commodification and Criticism</h4>
            <p>
                As hipster culture gained popularity, it paradoxically became commodified, leading to critiques of its
                elitism
                and
                its
                irony-laden approach to culture. Despite this, hipsters remained influential tastemakers in fashion,
                music,
                and
                media.
