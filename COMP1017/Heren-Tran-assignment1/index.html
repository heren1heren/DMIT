            <h2>About Hipsters</h2>
            <p>
                A hipster is often defined as a subcultural figure who values independent thinking, counter-culture,
                and
                non-mainstream interests. The modern hipster movement took shape in the 2000s, especially among
                urban,
                young
                adults.
                Hipsters tend to gravitate toward alternative fashion, music, art, and lifestyles that
                emphasize creativity and individuality. Their distinct aesthetic often includes thrift-store
                clothing,
                vintage styles, and accessories that may seem ironic or retro, signaling the rejection of
                mass-market
                consumerism.

                <h3>History of Hipsterism</h3>
                <p>
                    The origins of hipsterism can be traced back to the 1940s in the United States, where the term
                    "hipster"
                    was
                    first
                    used to describe jazz aficionados who adopted the laid-back, rebellious lifestyle of
                    African-American
                    jazz
                    musicians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These early hipsters embraced the subversive spirit of jazz, which stood in contrast to the
                    mainstream
                    culture
                    of
                    the time, and were characterized by their bohemian attitudes, relaxed fashion, and love for
                    spontaneity.

                <p>
                    Hipster music is characterized by a preference for independent, alternative, and non-mainstream
                    sounds.
                    Rooted
                    in a
                    desire to discover unique and authentic artists, hipsters often gravitate toward indie rock, folk,
                    electronic,
                    and
                    experimental genres. Read more about hipster music here. [link the “here” text to the page on music]
