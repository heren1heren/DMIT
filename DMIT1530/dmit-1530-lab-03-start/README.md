# DMIT1530 â€“ Web Design Fundamentals II 

## Lab 03 - SVG Icons & Positioning

This In-Class Lab is worth 5% of your overall grade.

You must be present in class in order to receive credit. 

---

## Instructions

Your task is to create a simple navigation component with SVG icons and notification badges. 

Your CSS must follow a mobile-first methodology and use top-down logic in order to create a solution that looks as reasonably close to the provided screenshots as possible. 


## Methodology 

1. Change the content of the `author` meta tag and write a semantic `<title>` in the `<head>` of the HTML.

2. Write the markup for a responsive navigation with the following content.

3. Begin your CSS with the most general or universal styles, followed by utility classes. 

4. Write and complete the styles required for the mobile (smallest) layout. 

5. Add a hover state to all links. All text and icons transition into the provided accent colour when the user hovers over a link.

6. Choose a breakpoint for the media query (for the desktop or 'large' layout). Write the required changes or additions to the styles that you need.


## Marking Guide

You will be awarded five (5) marks for a total of 5% of your overall grade. Your instructor will be checking to make sure that the following tasks are completed.

1. A single semantic HTML navigation component is used across all viewport sizes. 

2. Each icon is a minified SVG element and has a semantic `<title>`.

3. Notification badges are absolutely positioned relative to their respective menu links.

4. The SVG icon and notification badges are part of the anchor tag, making them clickable. 

5. When the viewport reaches a certain size, the navigation switches from a vertical orientation (a column) to a horizontal orientation (a row).

In addition to these tasks, your solution must look as reasonably close to the provided screenshots as possible. Your solution must also follow all current best practices for the web. This means that your solution must also incorporate concepts previously introduced in this course, such as media queries, maximum-width containers, and relative units of measurement.

**Note**: Your HTML and CSS must be valid - that is, your code must pass W3C Validation - in order to receive credit for this Lab.
