## Methodology

### Step One: Edit the HTML

All input fields must be filled out before the form can be submitted: add this check to your HTML. Do not add any attributes that are not required.

Add the HTML tag that is used to group related elements in a form: all input fields in this form will be in the same group.

Add the HTML attribute to all the <label> elements that indicates which form element that this label describes.

Add the HTML attribute to the inputs that specifies the kind of <input> expected within that element.

Where relevant, add the HTML attribute that uniquely identifies an individual HTML element.

Add the attribute to the checkbox input that will submit the word “sms-only” with the checkbox’s name to the server.

If relevant, add the HTML attribute that is used to reference elements when data from the form is submitted to the back end.

Add the attribute that will label the <submit> button with the word “Send”.


### Step Two: Edit the CSS

Use the colors, fonts, border styles, and so forth that your instructor has provided to get at close to the provided screenshot as possible. 

Add the CSS to prevent resizing of the <textarea>.

Add conditional styles that will show a cross (an x) in an input field if the input is invalid, or a check mark (a ✓) if the input is valid.

Note: Validation styles are not required for the <textarea>, checkbox, or submit button.

## Marking Guide

The lab will be out of a total of five (5) possible marks and worth 5% of your overall grade. Your instructor will be looking for five criteria:

- The HTML form uses appropriate form controls and input types for the data being captured. 

- Each form components has appropriate attributes (required, pattern, maxlength, etc.).

- Required form elements use CSS validation styles to indicate whether the entered data is valid or not.

- All tasks under 'Methodology' are completed.

In addition to these tasks, your solution must look as reasonably close to the provided screenshots as possible. Your solution must also follow all current best practices for the web. This means that your solution must also incorporate concepts previously introduced in this course, such as media queries, maximum-width containers, and relative units of measurement.

**Note**: Your HTML and CSS must be valid - that is, your code must pass W3C Validation - in order to receive credit for this Lab.
